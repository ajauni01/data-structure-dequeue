Using the queue or deque code from class, complete a programming solution for this problem:

Write a script that simulates a queue management system of a theme park ride (each of you decide your own specialized, creative ride).  No two programs should be the same as you add your own twist to this program.  The objective is to understand and implement a queue data structure, manage different types of visitors, and simulate the processing of visitors boarding the ride.

You must personalize the ride and what types of visitors will you manage,  you must decide on 3 different types of visitors (your own creative choice).  Add this creativity into your interface - make it unique to you!

I want you to implement some additional features:

implement a feature that limits the number of visitors on each ride cycle - for example, only 4 can board the ride at a time
track the total number of visitors who have boarded the ride and print a summary at the end of the simulation
Rules:

you can only use generative AI tools for support only
design, logic and code must be your own (theme it)
you should not copy from online sources
structure your code to be unique, reflecting your understanding of the problem and your own coding style
to ensure uniqueness, randomize elements (like ride duration and visitor types), must be implemented and tested
